# aac_irish_local

This project is an attempt to bring [aac_irish](https://github.com/OisinThomasMorrin/aac_irish) locally, a process which
will include the following feats:

- Rewriting the python project into a Systems Language (i.e. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)) for local use.
- Locally packaging [ABAIR](https://www.tcd.ie/research/start/abair.php)'s voices using the HTS speech synthesis system. 
- Transpiling third-party scripts and parsers into Rust. 

The end-goal is to create a [coughdrop](https://www.coughdrop.com/)) plugin from the locally packaged artifacts for deployment
and use by non-verbal individuals wishing to communicate through Irish.  

This project is being done for the [Phonetics and Speech Laboratory](https://www.tcd.ie/slscs/clcs/psl/) in Trinity College, Dublin.
