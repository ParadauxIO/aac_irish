# aac_irish

This project combines ABAIR's Irish language voices with a trio of parsers (tts_corrector.py):

1. An Gramad√≥ir's grammar checker (an_gramadoir.py)
2. ABAIR's genitive parser (genitive_parser.py)
3. my own morphological parser based on AAC boards (morphological_parser.py)

In order to create a self-correcting Irish language TTS API for use in AAC devices. 
This project also uses the voices developed at ABAIR (abair_voice.py).

Three pages are available from the flask server (flask_aac_irish.py):
1. Get voice of choice where the inputted text has been corrected. @ / 
2. Get correction of text alone.    @ /corrector 
3. Get hand-tuned parameterised hts voice. @ /voice
